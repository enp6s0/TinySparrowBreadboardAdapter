# TinySparrow breadboard adapter

Quick and dirty adapter for when you really need [TinySparrow](https://github.com/enp6s0/TinySparrow) on a breadboard. This
adapter makes for an easier prototyping experience, transforming TinySparrow into something that can be plugged directly
to a breadboard with 2x 16-pin 2.54mm headers with the same spacing as an Arduino Nano.

Board also provides nice breakout connectors for SWD programming/debug (5-pin 2.54mm) and a tap for the CAN bus (3-pin Phoenix 3.81mm)
